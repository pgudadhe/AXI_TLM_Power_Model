# SystemC TLM Based Power Model for AXI Interface

In this project, I will be modeling power behavior of our AXI interface connected to master and target. It is possible to model power with fair accuracy in early HW/SW CoDesign phase using TLM Power Modeling techniques when run in the AT style of transaction modeling. I will be using fused power modeling library in this project.
This library can be downloaded as below:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/UoS-EEC/fused
```

Follow the instruction to build the library. We will be linking this library in our AXI project.
I will also be using Power Logger wrapper created by zahrajnb in my code. This wrapper class provided useful utilities to simplify the use of fused library.

In this project we are going to imagine a scenario of a AXI Master and AXI Target module connected by AMBA AXI4 bus. The master could be a hardware accelerator creating a series of Read/Write demands to the target which could be the host memory. I assume that behind the development of this performance model, the intention of the Architect is to find out what would the most optimal bandwidth for Read and Write bus of the AXI data channel. AXI bus consists of multiple channels address, data, response channels for both read and write operations as shown below:

Further details can be found at AXI spec which tell about specific signals contained in these buses. For example, Write Address Channel contains awburst, awaddr, awlen, awsize, awready, awvalid signals and buses. But we are not aiming to model a Pin Accurate model of this scenario like an RTL. Our aim is to build an Approximately Timed (AT) Transaction Level Model (TLM) using SystemC for this scenario in order to observe Read/Write throughput in this scanrio by tweaking crucial knobs for this design as we will look ahead in details.

## Building the model:

This project utilizes CMake inorder to build. I assume that your enviornment has been setup using SystemC+WSL+VSCode set up that I have explained in previous post [here](https://pgudadhe.github.io/).
Follow the steps in these articles to build the model.

## Configurations:

This model provides various knobs to configure various scenarios.

```bash
Usage: ./AXI_TLM_PERF_MODEL [options]
Options:
  -h                           Show this help message
  -n <no. of reqs>             Specify number of R/W requests
  -s <request size>            Specify request size in bytes (default 0: 4B to 4096B randomized size), else: Absolute fixed size
  -r <Wr to Rd ratio>          Specify the ratio of Write requests vs. Read. eg. 0.7: 70% Write reqs, 30% Read reqs.
  -d <debug level>             Specify debug level (0-3)
  -rb <AXI Read Bus Width>     Read bus width. 0:4B, 1:8B, 2:16B 3:32B, 4:64B
  -wb <AXI Read Bus Width>     Write bus width. 0:4B, 1:8B, 2:16B 3:32B, 4:64B
Example: ./AXI_TLM_PERF_MODEL -n 10 -r 0.5 -rb 2 -wb 3
This will run the simulation with 10 requests, 50% Write & 50% Read requests,
with Read bus width of 16B and Write bus width of 32B.
Default values: -n 10, -r 0.5, -rb 0, -wb 0
```

| Commandline Option      | Description |
| ----------- | ----------- |
| n | Users can specify the number of requests that need to be made to the AXI target |
| s | Users can keep a fixed size of all requests (upto 4KB) or it can be randomized |
| r | No. of Read requests vs Write requests can be randomized based on probability distribution of Bernoulli |
| rb/wr | Key knobs of this model where user can vary the bandwidth of the Read and Write data buses |

Running the model with default options would show an output like this:

```bash
Info: /OSCI/SystemC: Simulation stopped by user.
Total Read Delay: 32730 ns 
Total Write Delay: 20750 ns
```

## Power Data Analysis:
I ran multiple experiments on this model collecting data by varying these knobs individually or together. Based on the data I collected, this is the performance analysis I observed.
