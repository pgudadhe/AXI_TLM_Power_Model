# SystemC TLM Based Power Model for AXI Interface

In this project, I will be modeling power behavior of our AXI interface connected to master and target. It is possible to model power with fair accuracy in early HW/SW CoDesign phase using TLM Power Modeling techniques when run in the AT style of transaction modeling. I will be using fused power modeling library in this project.
This library can be downloaded as below:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/UoS-EEC/fused
```

Follow the instruction to build the library. We will be linking this library in our AXI project.
